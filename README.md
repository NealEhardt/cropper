Quickly cut features out of images.  Use green paint for the parts you want; use red for the parts you don't.


The UI is made in [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.org), so I suggest running and building with NetBeans.

# To-Do

* Better jar signing to tame security dialogs
* Provide better anti-aliasing on "hardest" edge setting
* Allow local debugging (javax.jnlp.FileOpenService import causes ClassNotFoundException)
* Include jhlabs code as submodule, not copypasta
